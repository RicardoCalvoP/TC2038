Prim's Algorithm to solve the cable problem.

This module calculates the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for an undirected graph
using Prim's algorithm. It identifies the cheapest way to connect all nodes
with cables.

Returns:
    - mst_edges (list): List of edges in the MST as (node1, node2, weight).
    - total_cost (int): Total cost of the MST.
