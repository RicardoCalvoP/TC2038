Prim's Algorithm to get the cheapest path to set cable
to connect all nodes

    Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for an undirected graph using Prim's algorithm.

    Args:
        graph (list of list of int): Adjacency matrix representing the graph.

    Returns:
        tuple:
            - mst_edges (list): List of edges in the MST as (node1, node2, weight).
            - total_cost (int): Total cost of the MST.
